## Because every app needs a stuntman!

VSStuntman is an add-on for the PSStuntman PowerShell module. It allows you to import the saved stuntman from the PSStuntman database, directly into VSCode as a PowerShell code snippet. 

The PowerShell snippet is formatted as a HelloID person object. This makes it a little easier to develop HelloID connectors within VSCode.
